# Functional Programming

## Week 1

### Day 1

Today we got the assignment explained by an employee of the OBA.
We got an API endpoint, which we will need to fetch data from and show the user an interesting story with it.

After getting the assignment we got a bootcamp of Titus, which showed a lot of functional programming ins-and-outs I already knew, however some things, like `String.prototype.endsWith()`, I had never heard of before.

The rest of the time we tried to get the API to work with JavaScript ([Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)). Here we already pretty much hit a wall, knowing that the API is really bad and outdated.

### Day 2

Today I started thinking of questions, which I could answer by looking at the data I could gather.
I have thought of the following questions:

1. Has the amount of different book genres published, in the past _x_ years, declined?
2. Has the amount of books that is rented out decreased in the past _x_ years?
